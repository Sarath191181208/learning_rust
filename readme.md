I wanted to track my progress of learning Rust and I wanted to share some of the things I've learned.
Therefore I created this repository. It contains some snippets of code I've written and some of the things I've learned from day 1.

The learning projects I have currently built are:

1. [Number guessing game CLI in Rust with colored text.](#number-guessing-game-cli-in-rust-with-colored-text)

# Number guessing game CLI in Rust with colored text.

## Demo
